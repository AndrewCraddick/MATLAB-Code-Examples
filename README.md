# MATLAB-Code-Examples
Examples of my code written to simulate electric and magnetic fields produced by various static charge/current distributions

All simulations are performed using Colomb's Law or Biot Savart's Law. This causes the coding to be far more difficult because I do not utilize symmetry inherent to the charge/current distribution. The benefit is that simulating distributions using these laws rather than those which rely on symmetry (Gauss's Law and Ampere's Law) is that I develop an approach to simulate the distribution which works under circumstances where the distribution lacks symmetry; A computationally heavy brute force method must be applied.

For this reason, the code is frequently longer than would typically be needed to simulate relatively simple situations such as a perfect ring of charge where assumptions based on symmetry drastically simplify and reduce the complexity of the approach needed to accurately simulate the distribution.

Nevertheless, I was very satisfied with my results and was forced to think creatively to mathematically represent the ditributions and impliment those representations in efficient executable code.

In this repository there are simulations of:

- Electric field and electric potential due to a ring of charge
- Magnetic field of a physical dipole
- Isosurfaces of equipotential due to a uniformly charged sphere *
- Isosurfaces of equipotential due to a charged sphere in the presence of a separate charged particle *
- Magnetic field of a short and "long" solenoid (which is modeled as a helix using parametric equations) *
- Magnetic field of a helmholtz coil *

 (more advanced examples are denoted with an "*")
 
 Some examples contain more explanatory comments than others.
